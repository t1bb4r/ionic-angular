 *
 * // first page (publish an event when a user is created)
 * function createUser(user) {
 *   console.log('User created!')
 *   events.publish('user:created', user);
 * }
 *
 * // second page (listen for the user created event)
 * events.subscribe('user:created', (userEventData) => {
 *   // userEventData is an array of parameters, so grab our first and only arg
 *   console.log('Welcome', userEventData[0]);
 * });
